// What is api gateway why its needed

earlier there was monolithic arch all our bakend was in a single server 
saari requests ek hii server pe jaaye gi 

aaj bhi use hota hai monolithic arch 

DEVIDING THE BACKEDN CODE IN DIFFERENT PARTS
It decouplled the system into different parts made it fault tolrent 

but got another problem :
Hrr serer ke liye alag authN and authZ hoga 
ssl check : ki request https hii aaye

frontend app should know the address of all the servers


API GATEWAY : iske andar saare authN and authZ , rate limit ,  ssl routing sab hoga
user koi bhi request bheje ga toh directly server ko naa jaake api gateway prr jaaye gi
