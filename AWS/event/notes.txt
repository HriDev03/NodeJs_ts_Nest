Event Bridge is a serverless event bus use to handle pub/sub
type of arch patterns

We can create a serverless event bus using event bridge and it can 
inject events from veriety of sources 
sources can be custom application/ec2/lambda/containerised application,
IT can be mongoDB, SAAS AAP, Auth0
it also supports aws services to push services to event bridge

-----------------------------------------
once there are events bus then we can start with rules
these rules are filters wehere we can look at the content of an event 
(300 rules per event bus )

these rules are then connected to multiple targets
** upto 5 targets per rule **

what would happen if event bridge cant send to one of the targets
event bridge will send the message to target till 24 hours with exponential time gap

and then to handle that failed we can attatch a dlq for that
DLQ is a SQS queue and we can connect it to the targets

CONTENT BASED FILTERING
EVENT ARCHIVES AND PLAYBACKS
SCHEMA REGISTERY:to record the schema of evetns and we can structure them 

//resource based policy : require if we want to give permisions to other services to access event bridge

// now we can create our event bus and then we can send events to this event bus
by clicking on send events 

can give an event source and add detail type of the evet and also in the event detail 
we will add the json payload of the event

//when we are sending this event it is also inclding other stuff in the entire event envelop
{
  "version": "0",
  "id": "e5457e84-a826-8df9-af85-1f7cf78bd16a",
  "detail-type": "orderCreated",
  "source": "my-ecom-app",
  "account": "003457291292",
  "time": "2025-08-12T10:17:47Z",
  "region": "ap-south-1",
  "resources": [],
  "detail": {
    "orderID": 100,
    "quantity": 10
  }
}

//event pattern. is used to decide if we want to sens a particular event from the service to the target 
//this is an event rule and it is telling that and event is sent to the target only if its quantity is >5
{
  "source": ["my-ecom-app"],
  "detail-type": ["orderCreated"],
  "detail": {
  "quantity": [ { "numeric": [ ">", 5 ] } ],
    
  }
}
