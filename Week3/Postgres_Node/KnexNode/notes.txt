What are Migrations?
Migrations are like version control for your database schema.
They are JavaScript files that define changes to your database structure (e.g., creating tables, adding columns, modifying indexes).
Each migration file usually describes a small change, like “create users table” or “add email column to users”.

Migrations help you:
Track changes to your database schema over time.
Share schema changes easily with your team.
Apply or rollback schema changes consistently across different environments (dev, staging, prod).
The directory: __dirname + '/knex/migrations' setting tells Knex:
“Look for migration files in this folder inside my project.”





What are Seeds?
Seeds are scripts that populate your database with initial or sample data.
They’re useful to add default users, configuration, or test data into tables after they are created.

Seeds help you:
Set up your database with basic data for development or testing.
Ensure consistent starting data across different environments.
Quickly reset and repopulate your database during development.
The directory: __dirname + '/knex/seeds' setting tells Knex:
“Look for seed files in this folder inside my project.”




2) about scripts 
"migrate":"knex migrate:latest",

It runs all pending migrations that have not been run yet.

It updates your database schema to the latest version based on your migration files.

This means if you added new migration files since the last time you ran it, those changes will be applied to your database.


// PG : POSTRES CLIENT

// some commands

    "migrate":"knex migrate:latest", : Runs all pending migration files to update your database schema to the latest version.

    "make":"knex migrate:make", : Creates a new migration file inside your migrations folder (like knex/migrations/) with the name you provide.
