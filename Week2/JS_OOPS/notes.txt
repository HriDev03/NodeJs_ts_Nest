Objects & Properties
Object literals vs constructors
Property descriptors (configurable, enumerable, writable)
Getters/setters
this Keyword
Implicit, explicit (call, apply, bind), and new binding
Arrow functions vs regular functions
Constructors & Prototypes
Constructor functions
prototype property vs __proto__
4 .Inheritance
Prototypal inheritance
extends and super
Method overriding






JS AND CLASSES
oops is a programming style-----------> OOPS based , Functional based

OOPS : Away to write our code and we think everything in the form of an object
other ways : Procedural , Functional 
Angular built upon the concept of OOPS

Kya classes hoti hai in Js ? 
---> it was introduced in ES6 , Js is a prototype based language
classes are syntactic sugar based on prototypes, Gives syntax for Devs coming from class based language


what is OOPS ?
A programing style 

OBJECT : COLLECTION OF PROPERTIES AND METHODS
-> toLowercase() , promises , toUppercase()

parts of OOPS?
Object literal :  {}
constructor functions
prototypes

-- Constructor functions
-- PROTOTYPES (proto , prototypes ,  prototypal Inheritance)
-- CLASSES
-- INSTANCES (new,this)


KEYWORDS : 
Abstraction : to hide details of the implimentation (fetch)
Encapsulation : to encapsulate/wrap data in a class
Inheritance : To inherit the property of a parent and we can access it's metods
Polymorphism : Many Versions of the same method , A single method can perform many functions (console.log())


Agar multiple users bananehai toh baar baar code repeate karnaa padhta

    const user2={
        firstName: 'Hri',
        lastName:"Sharma",
        age:'2003',

        // getAgeYear:function(){
        //     return new Date().getFullYear()-user.age
        // }
        getAgeYear(){
            return new Date().getFullYear()-user2.age
        }
    }



to solve this issue we got factory function
it is like a factory we will provide the input and well get an object as an output
FACTORY FUNCTIONS : FUNCTIONS THAT WILL RETURN US OBJECTS


/*
    function createUser(firstName,lastName,age){
        const user={
            // if key and values are same no need to write them seperately            firstName:firstName,
            firstName,
            lastName,
            age,
            // created only once in the memory
            getBirthYear(){
                return new Date().getFullYear()-user.age
            }
        }
        return user
    }

    const user3=createUser('Hri','Sharma',22)
    const user4=createUser('Hridyesh','Sharma',20 )
*/

Now all this data stores seperately inside different memory location that was not efficient
in global scope THIS refers to the global scope
But when called for an object this will point to that particular object
created only once in the memory

polymorphism : it works for all the changing values
but this breaks abstraction



/*

    -------------------------------  THIS KEYWORD -----------------------------------------
    THIS IS A KEYWORD IN Js that we can access , in global scope it points to window Object
    and it is used to point to a particular object

    if we cal THIS INSIDE AN OBJECT it will point to that object

*/

// java script gives us ways to make our function private
// when we use new keyword in front of a function itll return an object

--------------------------------------      CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION        -------------------------------
function CreateUser(firstName,lastName,age){
    // if key and values are same no need to write them seperately firstName:firstName,
    this.firstName=firstName
    this.lastName=lastName
    this.age=age
}

// sabko iss ka access mill jaaye ga  aur ek hii jagah rahe ga
CreateUser.prototype.getBirthYear = function(){
    return new Date().getFullYear()-this.age
}

// function we are calling by using our new keyword is our construcor function
// new createUser("hii")

const user1=new CreateUser("Hri","sharma",21)
// without new keyword this will point to window object
const user2= CreateUser("Hri","sharma",21)


--------------------------      PROTOTYPES        -------------------------------------------------------
jab costructor function ko call karege with new keyword Itll return us an object
and this will point to that particular object , and then we insert the required value



    Definition of Prototype (in JavaScript):
        A prototype is an object that other objects can inherit properties and methods from. In JavaScript, 
        every function has a .prototype property, and every object has an internal [[Prototype]] (accessible via __proto__),
        which forms the basis of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.

    Think of it like this:
        A prototype is a blueprint for objects.

    If an object doesn't have a property or method, JavaScript looks up its prototype to try to find it.

    Example:
        
        function Person(name) {
             this.name = name;
        }

        // Add a method to the prototype
        Person.prototype.greet = function() {
            console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
        };

    const p1 = new Person("Alice");

    // greet is not defined on p1 directly...
    console.log(p1.greet); // Found via prototype chain

    Summary:
   
    .prototype → Property on a constructor function, used to define what instances inherit.

    __proto__ → Internal reference on an object, points to its prototype (usually the 
    .prototype of the constructor that made it).

// every function has a prototype property
// when we make an object using a constructor function prototype property will be attatched and will be called [    _proto_     ]
// if we created some function and add it into prototype of the constructor function it also moves to the object made by it in the form of proto
