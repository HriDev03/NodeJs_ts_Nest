it allows us to break a large code into small steps 
and with the help of these steps we can connect them by using
callbacks, promises  and async await 


Sync vs Async : 
10 tasks and one hand : we will do it one by one 
thats sync 

in async we kinda have 10 tasks and 10 hands

if image is loading sync itll load one by one 
the second image wont load until the first one loads 

but if images are loading async itll load seperately according to their own time
nothing stops for anyone , the system still continues to run
