Anything which happens at a particular time is an event 
event driven programming : we wrote a logic which will run when an event happens
when someone joins its an event and when someone leaves that an event 

every event will be attathed to one or more event listeners 
and they will run in sequential  order , create events , attatch them 

like when we create to db , on sucessfull execution it emits an event
and if there is some error it emits an error handling event
