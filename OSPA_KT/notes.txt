OSPA : Other States Admin policy
where we are storing other states policy

other states : states other than texas
to handle the policy for other states 


how they handle : 3rd party : ArgoNaut insaurance
so what they do ? from argo they have own app argo insec 
from there they will send data to ospa and from that itll flow to policy center

in ospa txm team  has the data where there is data for other states policy and quotes and can do some actions in the app 

3rd party (argo naut)------>ospa txm ------------> policy center

how they are doing this

two parties :

txm and os 
texas policies are maintained by txm 
and other states are maintained by ArgoNaut


quote->issued->policies 

what argo is doing 
ATID: it is a field which is connecting both texas details and other state details 

when argo is creating a quote and sending it to ospa 
they are also maintaining a connection between texas policy , every quote/policy is connected to texas policy sa they all eventually come under texas mutual 


OS policy is linked with Texas policy 
and OS QUOTE is linked with other state quote

there is an argo person they logged in and entered data regarding a quote and generated to the quote

sending notification to ospa about generating new quote 

ospa will ask about quote info and store it in os db

OS VENDOR DATA and OS POLICY TABLE (these are 2 tables where we are storing other states data)

after storing os info we will send request to enable other state tab 

texas policy is stored in policy center by txm 

so txm storing all txm-policy-data or txm-quote-data in policy center which is guidewire..
other states info also transfer to policy center 


so for every tx state policy or quote which is connected to other state we have a tab called : other state tab

as an exaple we have a quote:1234 which is connecte to tx quote:567
so in policy center for policy 567 the other states tab will be enabled and user will be able to see the other states info

3rd party ------> MULESOFT ---------->OSPA

policy-center (ONLY TX RELATED DATA IS THERE)

// OSPA will send info to policy center : policy center will send the tx related info in the ospa which is displayed in the UI

// THE APP WHICH IS BEING BUILT :
when a policy is made it is storing in 2 tables OS POLICY , OS VENDOR DATA                                            

======================                              
|     3 Tabs              : OS POLICY DETAILS , OS VENDOR SEARCH , ADMIN             
======================


os vendor search : data saved in os vendor db is displayed in os vendor search 

vendor : who is the transaction which we got from argo 
there are different system based on where these policies are coming from 



OS POLICY quote search is the main chunk of the application : doing all the 
interations with policy center and then with ARGO 

and sending charge to billing center
data coming from os policy and also some tx data from policy center 
OS policy mai bhi tx ki info show hoti hai aur baki other states waala toh hai hii

AS a OSPA USER we can edit os policies , admin have those priveledges 

remove link : we can remove the link of the tx policy and can relink by clicking on edit 

link wil come from argo and argo will make this atid field 

And to issue a policy we will get a bind request from POLICY CENTER and then from there we will send it to argo

THERE IS A BIND REQUEST that comes FROM policy center to OSPA (you have to issue this policy)
then after validations we will tell argo that we need to issue this policy

ARGO dosent have any access to OSPA so then txm will get notification to check ospa to issue this policy
TXM person will come to other state policy admin  and issue the policy 

and also update the texas db

and on the billing center there is some charged calculated amount that ospa will send to billing center 

OSPA sending policy data to policy center also to illing center 

we have different center when ever OSPA sends data to billingcenter we create a transaction which is called as policy transaction
by the billing center api 

in the policy change we have different policies based on the transport 
every transport will have their own calculation and their own rules 

Majorly we have 3 teams : Mulesot + ospa(AWS + JAVA) + guiedwire(policy center and billing center)

Modernise the OLD APP-----> 

if os supervisor opens that may not have the full priveledges and all this record is present in the os log table 

everyday at 6am it ll clear all the records that are present in os lock table 
and that lock will actomatically will get removed 

change policy status for expired policy , and change status of policies that are expired and should run thrice a day
